\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
Use mixture of Herbert a simon architecture of complexity, Michalski, Fisher, Han, Mirkin, Jain, Berkhin, Concept formation in psychology rosch, gluck, corter,..., trestle, query optimizazion for un or semi structured databases

\section{Contributions}
NOTICE CONTRIBUTIONS CLEARLY: 
1. SURVEY \& EVALUATION OF CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS
2. MULTI-PHASE CLUSTERING WITH DENDROGRAM FLATTENIONG
2.1 occurence of problems, noise, ... solution is 3.
3. IMPLEMENTATION OF CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERING/COBWEB
4. ADAPTION TO GRAPH SCENARIO, GENERALIZATION OF PROPERTY CONTAINERS IN THE GRAPH
5. FLEXIBILITY OF THE PIPELINE, POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS TO SUPPORT QUERY OPTIMIZATION 

Theodoros: more? less? what are the contributions and how to make it shiny but not too shiny
