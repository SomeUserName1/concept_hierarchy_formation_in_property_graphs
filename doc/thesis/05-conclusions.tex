\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Applications}
% include dep type system in Leo's cypher compiler
% derive types from unstructured dbs to gen rdbms schemas
% cluster types of events with value based method

\section{Future Work}
% take input from classifier, do uncertainty based clust, use prob. dep. ts
% same for edges
