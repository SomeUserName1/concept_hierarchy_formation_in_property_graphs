\chapter{Conclusion}\label{\positionnumber}
\section{Applications}\label{\positionnumber}
query optimization, graph compression, associative index \& storing (INSOM) wake sleep algorithm with unsupervised pretraining, unsupervised concept formation, supervised feature optimisation, ...
\section{Future Work}\label{\positionnumber}
Extensions by other people to refine hierarchy, to not safe data objects as leafs but just connect their indexes, use more than gaussian to model numerics, use numerically stable optimization (no +- with float just */<<>> ...), Use label based features, improve performance, bayesian version
