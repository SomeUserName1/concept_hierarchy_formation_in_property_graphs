# Graph Structuring Toolbox

Integrate with: Neo4J  
[NeoProfiler](https://github.com/moxious/neoprofiler)
Example with Cypher only on only one data set done by hand: [Barrasa, 2017](https://jbarrasa.com/2017/03/31/quickgraph5-learning-a-taxonomy-from-your-tagged-data/)
[Second Example; brief](https://neo4j.com/blog/data-profiling-holistic-view-neo4j/)

This project is intended to provide tools that help to extract further structure 
from graphs, especially Neo4J data sets, in order to support cardinality estimation  

## 1. Pre-Processing
Currently only data set specific loaders and an interface  
Shall be able to sample and filter data to induce certain conditions
(e.g. only cluster instances with a certain category as property)  

## 2. Clustering
Currently only multi-line properties of nodes.  
Shall at some point discover sub-labels/"types" for Nodes, later maybe also for
edges, incoming and outgoing sets and sub-graphs

Algorithms to implement:  
- Linkage-based clustering (single and complete linkage) (for nodes)  => Finished, bad performance!
- HDBSCAN: state of the art, performance comparable to K-Means, hierarchical, supports soft clustering (200000 2d points in < 60s reference implementation: [SkLearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan))
    Implement extending [SMILE](https://github.com/haifengl/smile/tree/master/core/src/main/java/smile/clustering)  
    eventually extend using min cuts based on relative inter cluster connectivity and closeness;
- Adapted version of chameleon clustering (for sub-graphs) (maybe considered later, if HDBSCAN is bad)

TODO: Metrics (e.g. InfoGain, Fisher Info/Score, Shilouette coef., lift, ...)  

## 3. Sub-Graph Mining
future work, maybe FP-Tree and Apriori-Based. See literature/GraphMining  
Maybe DIMSpan?

## 4. Visualization
Shall provide a wrapper to call algorithm specific visualizations 
(e.g. Dendrogram, ...) and put them into the profiler report


__Update 05.05.19:__  
Depending on the workload of implementing the neccessary clustering and graph analysis algorithms in Java e.g. with SMILE and if working ultimately with Neo4J, another approach would be to interface Java with Python using [Py4J](https://www.py4j.org/index.html).  
This would evade all implementation costs but only work for a prototype as this exposes the JVM on the network, letting any user on the machine execute arbitary Java code.
Definitely not useful when integrating with a database; maybe look up what parts are already there from N4J and add features as feasible and neccessary.




Todo: 
- Canopoy
- Svd/PCA/tSNE on data => all other of sklearn
- Cobweb
