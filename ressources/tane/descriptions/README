DESCRIPTION FILE ATTRIBUTES

Umask = <value>
	Sets umask for created files and directories. 
	Example:  Umask = 007
BaseName = <value>
	The value of variable $BASENAME. Each occurrence of "$BASENAME" 
	on the right-hand side will be replaced with this value. This is
	also the name of the relation in the Savnik&Flach format output.
	The default value is the name of the description file without 
	path and extensions.
DataIn = <file>
	The input data file. The file must be in standard format, but can
	contain non-integer data.
Lines = <list>
	The lines (tuples) of input data to be included in the output.
	Example: Lines = 1,2,10-50,8,16,32
NoOfCopies = <number>
	Make <number> copies of each row. Default is 1.
	Every value in each additional copy is replaced with a value that
	is a function of the original value and the number of the copy.
	That is, each value is different from the corresponding values 
	in the original and other copies, but if two values in the original 
	file are the same, then the corresponding values in i'th copies
	are the same, too, for all i.
AttributesIn = <file>
	File containing the original attribute names of the input data.
Attributes = <list>
	Attributes of input data to be included in the output data.
	Example: Attributes = AEDAC
	Accepted attribute characters are [A-Za-z0-9_+] corresponding 
	to attributes 1-64.
AttributesOut = <file>
	Output file for the original attribute names of the output data.
ToIntegers = <boolean>
	Whether to transform the values to integers or not. Default is on.
	Values "OFF", "NO", "FALSE", "0", or nothing (empty) turn it off.
StandardOut = <file>
	Standard format output file.
SavnikFlachOut = <file>
	Savnik&Flach format output file.


* All but DataIn are optional.
* The order of attributes does not matter except BaseName affects only
  attributes coming after it.
* Lines beginning with '#' or not containing '=' are ignored.
* Specifying files and directories:
	- '-' is standard input/output.
	- A path beginning with '/' is an absolute path.
	- Otherwise the path is relative to the directory containing
	  the description file.
